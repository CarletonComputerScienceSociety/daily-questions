# July 5, 2019 - Longest consecutive sequence [Hard]

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest 
consecutive elements sequence.

Your algorithm should run in O(n) complexity.

Example:
```
Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]

Ouput: 4

Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3 ,4], therefore its 
length is 4.
```
