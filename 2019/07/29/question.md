Given a string and a set of search strings, return a map with the search 
strings as keys and the number of occurences for each search string as values. 
This search should be case insensitive.

Example:
```
Input: 
string = "Blue hair, blue tie, hiding in your wi-fi"
search = {"blue", "red", "wi-fi"}

Output:
{"blue": 2, "red": 0, "wifi": 1}
```
