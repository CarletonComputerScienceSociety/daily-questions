# July 17, 2019 - Level order traversal [Medium]

Given a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values 
(ie, from left to right, level by level).

Example:
```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

return its level order traversal as:
[
  [3],
  [9,20],
  [15,7]
]
```
