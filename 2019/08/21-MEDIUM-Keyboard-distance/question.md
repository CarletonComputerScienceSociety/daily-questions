# August 21, 2019 - Keyboard distance [Medium]

Write a function that takes two keys in the range A-Z as input and returns 
the distance between the two keys on a QWERTY keyboard. The distance between 
two keys is the minimum number of hops between adjacent keys required to get 
from one key to the other.

Consider the key `A`: Its adjacent keys are `Q`, `W`, `S`, and `Z`.

Example:
```
Input: 'D' and 'Y'
Output: 3

Input: 'A' and 'S'
Output: 1

Input: 'A' and 'A'
Output: 0
```
