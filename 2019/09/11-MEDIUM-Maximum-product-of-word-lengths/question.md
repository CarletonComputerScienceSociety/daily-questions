# September 11, 2019 - Maximum product of word lengths [Medium]

Given an array of strings containing only lowercase letters, find maximum 
product of the length of two strings where the two strings do not contain 
any common letters.

If no such product is possible, return `0`.

Example:
```
Input: ["abcw", "baz", "foo", "bar", "xtfn", "abcdef"]
Output: 16 // product of "abcw" and "xtfn"
```
