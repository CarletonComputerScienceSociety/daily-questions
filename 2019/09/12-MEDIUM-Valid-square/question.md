# September 12, 2019 - Valid square [Medium]

Given a set of four x-y coordinates, determine is a square can be constructed 
from the four points.

A valid square has four equal sides with positive length and four equal angles.

Both positive an negative values can be used to form valid squares.

Example:
```
Input: p1 = [0,0], p2 = [1,1], p3 = [1,0], p4 = [0,1]
Output: true
```
